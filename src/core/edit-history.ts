//   someone else's edit, delete their own entry and be replaced by that
//   someone. A dashboard body is never empty, so an empty body counts as none.
// - "end-of-history": the stretch reaches the end of the kept history, or the
//   gap in it, without an entry in which the tick was not there.
// - "not-in-newest-entry": the newest entry does not hold the tick, so the
//   body the tick was read from is not the body the history ends with. The
