  sluiceway init [--force] [path]
      Write .github/workflows/deploy-dashboard.yml and, when there is none,
      a first sluiceway.yaml, from the stacks it finds in the repo. It never
      overwrites a file. --force writes the workflow again.
  sluiceway check [path]
      Say which stacks it finds, and whether sluiceway.yaml and the
      workflow are right.
  sluiceway --version
  sluiceway --help

Both read the files at path, or where you stand, and nothing else: no
credentials, no token, no tool, no network. scan, resolve, apply and settle
run only in the workflow.

${DOCS.init}

With the Sluiceway app, as the person whose token it is:
  sluiceway login          Paste a token from the app, or pipe it in.
  sluiceway logout
  sluiceway status [repo]  The org's stacks, or a repo's, by state.
  sluiceway stack <repo> <stack id>
                           A stack's row and its preview page.
  sluiceway preview <repo> <stack id>
                           Every change of the stack's preview, read from
                           its preview page on GitHub through the app.
  sluiceway tick <repo> <stack id> [--yes]
                           Tick it. A destroy needs --yes. Prints the
                           deployment record once it waits to start.
  sluiceway rescan <repo>  Ask GitHub for a full scan.
  sluiceway settings <repo> [set <key>=<value> ...]
                           Read the keys, or open a pull request that
                           sets them.

These call the app alone, over HTTPS, and never GitHub. --json answers in
JSON, and --app <address> names another app than ${DEFAULT_APP}.
Exit codes: 0 done, 1 failed, 2 not understood, 3 not signed in, 4 not
found, 5 refused, 6 try again later.`;
